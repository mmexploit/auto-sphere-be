Hi,
Thanks for signing up for a Autosphere account. We're excited to have you on board!
For future reference, your user ID number is {{.userID}}.
Please send a request to the `PUT /v1/users/activated` endpoint with the following JSON
body to activate your account:

{"token": "{{.activationToken}}"}

-- The url above and message should be changed to the front end url that displays the text input
field that accepts the token which will be then sent to PUT /v1/users/activated 

Please note that this is a one-time use token and it will expire in 3 days.
Thanks,
The Autosphere Team
